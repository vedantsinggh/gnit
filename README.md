# GNIT - a small and simple version control system for personal projects

## How to use 
-  `make build` to build the executable 
-  copy `gnit` executable to desired project
-  run `./gnit` to read the docs

## How to contribute/collab
connect me on socials @vedantsinggh on every platform <br>
or <br>
start by resolving already invoked issues

## Future goal 
Our aim is to implement version controlling with local as well as cloud commit just like github using as minimal as tech possible.<br>
We are openly looking for collaborators.

## Stack to be used 
- C++ for backend of web
- React (JS) for frontend of web
- Pure C++ for version contolling 
- Relational DB - either my SQL or postgreSQL
- deply on linux server and implement load balancing and shits
- or we could possiblily use node for such shits
